RGBdog invited 4 experimental electronic musicians working with Ableton, MaxMSP, TouchDesigner, neural networks and live coding.

In a lockdown situation in their bedrooms, the 4 musicians created audio-reactive visuals with their sound, actively using experimental technology.

BedroomLiveOut. is to support artists and to bring the community together to create and inspire experimental electronic music and the audio-visual world.
