“What does it mean to be human in the era of artificial intelligence?

This is a participatory, collective constitution project which involves artists, researchers and designers working creatively with technology, especially Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Together with other creatives, we aim to make a collective oath bringing the importance of making ethical decisions as a creator and share with fellow humans facing this change.
