Everything is shut down, cancelled and vaporised in the air. Whatever we were doing doesn't feel relavant any more. What can we do when every communication in a physical space shifts to the digital realm?

We invited 4 creatives to virtual dinner during lockdown in a world pandemic situation.

From four different cities, Amsterdam, Berlin, LA and Montreal, we immediately felt understood each other in a form of eating a meal together. When warm meals were in front of us, things happened natural and we had a very honest conversation about how our life and practice changed, sharing with our virtual audiences.
